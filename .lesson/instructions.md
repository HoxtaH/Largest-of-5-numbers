**Objective:**

Write a set of conditional statements that **returns** the largest number out of the 5 numbers that have been passed as **arguments.**  

 

# **Description:**

Lupin The Third needs help with a small algorithm that takes in 5 random numbers and returns the largest number of them all.  Lupin will use this algorithm as a piece to a larger hacking program.  This algorithm should be able to logically decide which of the five numbers is the largest no matter where the largest number is within the parameter references.

# **Output:** 

**largestOfFiveNumbers**(3,43,67,23,70);

```
Output: 70
```

**largestOfFiveNumbers(**7,3,2,6,4**);**

```
Output: 7
```

**largestOfFiveNumbers(**0.4,1.3,4.7,9.1,5.2**);**

```
Output: 9.1
```
